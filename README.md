Meticulously tracking the performance of our investment projects across projects A, B, C (within Malaysia), and F1 (China), F2 (United States). This data-driven exploration paints a revealing of our portfolio's strengths and opportunities.

Seasonality analysis unveils a compelling seasonal trend, with Q3 consistently outperforming as the top revenue generator across all regions, demonstrating a healthy annual sales increase. While Q2 exhibits a lull, strategic planning can leverage this knowledge to optimize marketing and sales efforts during this period.

Project F2 emerges as a consistent revenue champion, boasting the highest sales over the past three years in the U.S. market. This stellar performance warrants further investigation to identify and replicate its success factors.

There is positive growth across all projects except Project F1 in China. While we anticipate a downward trend for F1 in 2024, proactive measures can be implemented to mitigate this potential challenge.

The undisputed star of our portfolio is Project F2, with its exceptionally short payback period of 1.5 months and an impressive IRR of 195%. These remarkable figures highlight its significant contribution to our overall success and solidify its position as a prime candidate for further investment.
